# stickers

An annotated guide to my laptop stickers.

This is a very, very rough first pass.

Things to do

* Improve the editor
* Compress the images on upload
* Possibly encode in Base85 to reduce the size of the images
* Accept HEICs and convert them to JPEGs
* Add a way to "swap out" images, so that the annotations can be preserved when the image is updated
* Improve the colours when creating annotations
* Allow moving/removing/editing of points in annotations
* ~~Render line breaks in the annotations~~ **done**
